                                    Same Point for frontend and backend
1) Dockerfile.dev is used for development purpose and Dockerfile is used for production purpose.

2) .dockerignore file 


POINT 3) and 4) only if you are using building image for just to check else don't do these steps just do step 6 to make and run the container
3) To create an image of frontend or backend ---> [docker build -t image_name .] 

4) To create an container ---> [docker run -d -p 5500:5500 --name container_name image_name]
-d == means detached mode that means the container runs on new terminal not on current one

5) docker-compose.yaml file is used to run multiple containers at a time.

6) docker compose build --> then step - 6
7) To make a compose - [docker compose up -d]  in detached mode TO RUN thw whlole project

8) To stop the project - [docker compose down]

9) iN Backend use -L in this "dev": "nodemon -L server.js"
